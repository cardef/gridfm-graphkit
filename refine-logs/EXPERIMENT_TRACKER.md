# Experiment Tracker: Kron–Schur GridFM Scaling

**Date:** 2026-07-21

**Proposal SHA-256:** `d9a3b6d3810eaeb13cb1bbe24cff457a7bcacda038f517c7a4d90cc9e95ea1b7`

**Campaign status:** BLOCKED until I001–I010 and R014 are PASS.

**Proposal review:** PENDING for the G8/G16/G26 contract. The 9.05 / 10 READY
verdict covered G28 and is historical; the attempted G26 re-review failed
authentication before a verdict. No treatment is authorized.

**Status vocabulary:** `TODO`, `RUNNING`, `PASS`, `FAIL`, `BLOCKED`, `SKIPPED`.
**Legacy rule:** existing M0/M1 artifacts cannot change a status below.

## Immediate Queue

### Reconciled performed evidence

| Evidence | Observed state | Gate effect |
|---|---|---|
| Legacy M0 summaries | CPU wiring, profiling, overfit, reconstruction, mmap, and prototype hierarchy checks completed | engineering hints only; no status change |
| Legacy M1 MLflow experiment `702378410004452588` | 30 records: 11 finished, 19 stale; only Flat/case2000 finished; 238.675 one-GPU elapsed hours across finished records | not confirmatory; no I/R/E credit |
| Legacy M1 SLURM logs | 40 `.stfolder`/MLflow discovery failures plus cancellation, OOM, and Triton resource failures | adds fail-closed store smoke to I010 |
| Current Abacus backend | jobs 54583/54586 completed the last two initial pools; job 54676 audited all 55 and failed closed because 32 pools contain fewer successful PF outputs than requested and parallel branches were keyed only by endpoints | root cause is internal OPF setpoint-solve attrition inside PF mode plus a branch-identity audit bug; global retry-to-count and branch-ID fixes pass 12 focused tests (54682); no treatment launch is authorized |

1. **Data generation:** resume only the 32 incomplete pools under `deterministic_retry_to_fixed_success_count_v1`; preserve the frozen initial configs/base seeds and record every deterministic retry, solver drop, raw hash, and provenance hash.
2. **R003:** repair and re-audit the two source-development pools first, then run the bounded source-development-only geometry calibration and write its typed gate record while the remaining pool repairs continue.
3. **I010:** add a reviewed upstream-flat checkpoint fixture, then run CUDA compile/FLOP parity and largest-grid host/accelerator peaks on a GPU node after admissible data exist.
4. **R014:** only after every required I/R/C/P/S record is hashed PASS, materialize the explicit E001–E020 campaign and launch by manifest ID.
